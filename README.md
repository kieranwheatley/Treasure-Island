## Treasure Island - A C# text based game! ##
_This is currently a work in progress!_

## Current Status ##
* Start your adventure and join the Island!
* Move around the map (with text descriptions to set the scene!)

## Next Steps
* ~~Add the area descriptions to print when the player moves!~~
* Allow the user to pick up an item when they find them!
* Make it so the game can be won by dropping all the items!
* Make the item spawn positions random so it's different each time!
* Random player spawns on each play!
