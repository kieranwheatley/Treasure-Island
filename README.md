## Treasure Island - A C# text based game! ##
_This is currently a work in progress!_

When in college, I was tasked with creating Treasure Island for my OOP in Java assignment. I chose to recreate this in C# not only to practise my programming abilities, but also to see how much I have improved with practise. The game I originally produced was full of bugs, contained bad programming practises (not using methods for code that runs frequently (a lot of lines within the main method!)), had poor use of OOP, and was incredibly repetitive due to the hard coded spawns for players and objects.

## What is it? ##
Treasure Island is a text-based game where the player arrives on a deserted island. They must then move around the island and find 3 objects which they can pick up.
### How do you win? ###
Upon picking up and dropping all 3 items around the map, the player will win!


## Current Status ##
* Start your adventure and join the Island!
* Move around the map (with text descriptions to set the scene!)

## Next Steps
* ~~Add the area descriptions to print when the player moves!~~
* ~~Random player spawns on each play!~~
* Allow the user to pick up an item when they find them!
* Make the item spawn positions random so it's different each time!
* Make it so the game can be won by dropping all the items!
* Improvements to area descriptions
* Create a nicer experience within the console
* Potentially add sound files
